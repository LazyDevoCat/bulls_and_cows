### Rules

1) Secret Number:
Each player thinks of a secret number consisting of 4 digits.

All digits must be different.

(?) The number cannot start with 0 (optional rule, but common).

2) Making a Guess:
Players take turns trying to guess each other’s secret number.

3) Feedback – Bulls and Cows:
After a guess, the opponent gives feedback:  
  Bull = a correct digit in the correct position  
  Cow = a correct digit in the wrong position

Example:
Secret number: 4271
Guess: 1234

1 bull (the digit 2 is in the correct position)

2 cows (4 and 1 exist in the number but in different positions)

Winning the Game(?):
The first player to guess the secret number exactly (4 bulls) wins.
